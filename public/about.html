<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiastic beginner in the world of programming, having started my 
  journey recently. Eager to dive into the exciting realm of code, I am 
  currently exploring the basics and fundamentals of programming languages. Though
   new to this field, my curiosity and determination drive me to learn and grow 
   each day. In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books and playing games sometimes, which helps me stay balanced and inspired. I look forward to building my 
   skills and contributing to interesting projects as I continue to learn..</p>
